# Task 1: Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective

Conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset structure, class distribution, and key statistical summaries of photometric magnitudes and redshift values.

## Instructions

- Use appropriate visualizations and statistical summaries to present your findings.
- Perform datetime analysis on the dataset:
    - Investigate the temporal distribution of observations.
    - Determine peak observation times or identify seasonal trends using pandas datetime functionality.
- Summarize your observations and conclusions.

## Dataset

- **Data File:** `Task1.csv`
- **Metadata:** `Metadata.pdf`

## Reference Links

- [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [Visualization in Python](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html)

> **Tip:** Creative and attractive visualizations, as well as innovative approaches to data insights, will earn bonus points!
